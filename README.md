- Keras:
  - Image Data Generator: Generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation.
  The data will be looped over (in batches).
  - Sequential Model: A Sequential Model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.
